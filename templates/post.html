<!--
    This template is used by the post engine,
    and gets filled out with the content of the post.
    we say 'safe' just because we insert the datestamp
    using other html tags.

    Not to worry, user input for a post is stripped of HTML
    to make sure that (hopefully) no one can inject malicious stuff.
